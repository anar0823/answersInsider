Question 1

1) Functional Testing:
a) Verify that the pencil writes properly on different paper types.
b) Test the eraser's ability to cleanly erase marks without damaging the paper.
c) Check the durability of the lead and the eraser.

2) Usability Testing:
a) Assess the pencil’s comfort during prolonged use.
b) Test the ergonomics for different hand sizes.
c) Evaluate the ease of erasing and sharpening.

3) Performance Testing:
a) Measure how long the pencil can write before it needs sharpening.
b) Test how many erasures the eraser can handle before wearing out.

4) Load Testing:
a) Test the pencil’s lead under varying pressure levels to check for breaking points.

5) Stress Testing:
a) Apply extreme force on the pencil to test its structural integrity.
b) Test the eraser under aggressive use to see if it detaches or wears out quickly.

6) Security Testing:
a) Ensure that any materials used in the pencil (example: paint, rubber) are non-toxic and safe for users.
